    <p1>Here I will list the games that have been important to my life in some way or just games that I really enjoy. Video games are clearly something that hold a lot of value to me, which is made obvious by the career path I am pursuing. They have always been something that have been there to allow me to bond with others over and I have met some amazing people through them or because of them, including some of my closest friends.</p1><br>
